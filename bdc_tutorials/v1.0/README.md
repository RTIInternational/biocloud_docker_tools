# BioData Catalyst Tutorial

This Dockerfile provides a toy example to demonstrate how to [Bring Your Own Tool](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/community-tools-and-integration-1/bring-your-own-tool-s-to-biodata-catalyst). The script is simple and takes an RNA sequence and converts it to an amino acid sequence. 

## Overview

**What is BioData Catalyst**

The BDC ecosystem offers secure workspaces to support your data analysis in addition to a number of bioinformatics tools for analysis. 

**What is this tutorial for**

The NHLBI BioData Catalyst Data Management Center helps investigators bring their data to BioData Catalyst and use the platform. The [Navigating BioData Catalyst YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSIGopyrrU80U9oytmP6vbkOdtimi5FAb) offers short form tutorials to provide step-by-step instruction for using the platform. 

**What is BYOT**
BDC supports lots of different data types but not all. In some cases, datatypes may not have available tooling to help analyze the data. In this case, users can bring dockerized tools and workflows to the platform to aid in data analysis.

## Usage
This is a simple script that translates a default or user supplied RNA sequence into an amino-acid sequence. 

The following command can be used to run the docker: 
```
docker pull rtibiocloud/bdc_tutorial:<tagname>
docker run -it rtibiocloud/bdc_tutorial:<tagname> -c "Rscript /opt/bdc_tutorial/aa_translator.R --help"
```

<br>


## Build
To build this Docker image, you can use the following command:
```
docker build --rm -t rtibiocloud/bdc_tutorial:<tagname> -f Dockerfile .`
```
Here's what each part of the command does:

`docker build`: This command tells Docker to build an image.
`--rm`: This flag removes any intermediate containers that are created during the build process, helping to keep your system clean.
`-t bdc_tutorial:v1.0.0`: The -t flag specifies the name and tag for the image. In this case, it's named bdc_tutorial with version v1.0.0.
`-f Dockerfile`: This flag specifies the Dockerfile to use for building the image. You can replace Dockerfile with the actual name of your Dockerfile if it's different.
`.`: The dot at the end of the command indicates that the build context is the current directory, where the Dockerfile is located.
Running this command will build a Docker image with the name `bdc_tutorial:v1.0.0`. Make sure you are in the directory containing the Dockerfile you want to use for building the image.

## Perform a testrun
`docker run -it 69d989ee9140 bdc_tutorial testrun --id=check_install`

## Rscript Inputs
| Short Flag | Long Flag | Description |
|:-----:|:--------:|--------------------------------|
|   -i  |  --input     | RNA sequence to translate to amino acids             |
|   -o  |  --outfile   | File name for the output file                        |
|   -3  |  --three     | Display amino acids using three letter abbreviations |
|   -w  |  --write     | Write the translated sequence to file                |
|   -v  |  --verbose   | Display verbose logging                              |
|   -h  |  --help      | Display the function usage statement                 |

## Rscript Output
A file with the translated sequence with the following structure

```
STICK
```

<br>

If the --three flag was used the output will use this example format

```
Ser-Thr-Ile-Cys-Lys
```

A tab-delimited log file with 4 columns and a variable number of rows
|     Column     | Description                                            |
|:--------------:|--------------------------------------------------------|
|   Timestamp    | Time stamp when the message was logged                 |
|     Level      | Level of the message: info, debug, warning, error      |
|   Function     | The function that created the logging statment         |
|    Message     | The message generated by the script                    |

## Perform a testrun
`docker run -v ${PWD}/example_files/:/data -t rtibiocloud/bdc_tutorial:v1.0.0 /bin/bash  -c "Rscript /opt/bdc_tutorial/aa_translator.R -i CAUAUCUAA -3 -v -w"`
