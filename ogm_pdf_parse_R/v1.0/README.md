# Optical Genome Mapping PDF Parser

This Dockerfile sets up an environment for running an [Rscript](v1.0/ogm_pdf_parse.R) that takes the PDF output from an optical genome mapping run on the [BioNano Saphyr Instrument](https://bionano.com/saphyr-systems/) and exports either a set of tab delimited files or an excel spreadsheet (1 row per sample).

## Overview

**Optical Genome Mapping**

Optical genome mapping uses high-resolution imaging to map the structure and organization of an organism's genome, providing insights into large-scale genomic variations and architecture.

For the Regenerative Medicine Innovation Project (RMIP), the In-Depth Cell Characterization Hub (IDCCH) uses a BioNano Saphyr instrument to perform optical genome mapping. This instrument detects and quantifies genomic variation including single nucleotide changes and structural (e.g., insertions, deletions, inversions, and complex) and copy number variations. The output of this process is a .VCF file and a standardized PDF file.

The purpose of this docker is to run an Rscript that will take the PDF outputs generated by the IDCCH, extract key values from the PDF and export a standardized, machine readable, set of tab delimited files or an excel spreadsheet.

## Usage
The following command can be used to run the docker: 
```
docker pull rtibiocloud/ogm_pdf_parse_R:<tagname>
docker run -it rtibiocloud/ogm_pdf_parse_R:<tagname> -c "Rscript /opt/parser/ogm_pdf_parse.R --help"
```

Example Docker run command with volume mounting:
```bash
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/data -w /data rtibiocloud/ogm_pdf_parse_R:<tagname> /bin/bash -c " Rscript /opt/parser/ogm_pdf_parse.R -i /data/example.pdf -p /data -o example.tsv -v"
```

If not running the docker from the directory with the data, replace `${PWD}` with the actual path on your host system with the PDF outputs.

## Build
To build this Docker image, you can use the following command:
```
docker build --rm -t rtibiocloud/ogm_pdf_parse_R:<tagname> -f Dockerfile .
```
Here's what each part of the command does:

`docker build`: This command tells Docker to build an image.
`--rm`: This flag removes any intermediate containers that are created during the build process, helping to keep your system clean.
`-t rtibiocloud/ogm_pdf_parse_R:v1.0.0`: The -t flag specifies the name and tag for the image. In this case, it's named ogm_pdf_parse_R with version v1.0.0.
`-f Dockerfile`: This flag specifies the Dockerfile to use for building the image. You can replace Dockerfile with the actual name of your Dockerfile if it's different.
`.`: The dot at the end of the command indicates that the build context is the current directory, where the Dockerfile is located.
Running this command will build a Docker image with the name `rtibiocloud/ogm_pdf_parse_R:v1.0.0`. Make sure you are in the directory containing the Dockerfile you want to use for building the image.

## Rscript Output
Either an Excel spreadsheet, with three sheets (one for job details extracted from the last page, one for Filtered Structured Variants and one for Copy Number Variants) or two tab-delimited files (one for Filtered Structured Variants and one for Copy Number Variants). If output two tab-delimited files, the project information will be inculded within the Filtered Structured Variant file.
